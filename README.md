## ❓ FAQ <a name="faq"></a>

- **Why the app doesn't display all possible movies when I click on a genre in navigation bar?**

  - This is becuase of the way API works. The search performed in TVmaze API shows only first 10 results of the search. In order to see more movies we would have to use another API or upgrade our TVmaze account that was not required in this capstone project.

- **The layout of the pop-up would look better if the movie details were displayed to the right of the movie poster. Why didn't you use this approach?**

  - In this capstone project we are supposed to follow the medium-fidelity wireframes. According to these wireframes the details should be positioned below the image.
